# plaSquid: PLAsmid Search in seQuencIng Data.

### Description

- **plaSquid** is a Nextflow pipeline for plasmid detection and classification in genomic and metagenomic data. This pipeline uses either genomic or metagenomic *assemblies* as input. It uses two different approaches to look for plasmids: to search against a plasmidic database and to look for plasmid specific genes (i.e. RIP and *Relaxases*).

- **plaSquid** also classifies plasmids into replicon types and MOB groups by comparing RIPs or Relaxases against custom HMMs. 

- It summarises the information gathered by the two complementary approaches in a single output table and allows further analysis on plasmidic contigs as ir outputs plasmidic contigs in a multifasta file (*"Result.fasta"*)
